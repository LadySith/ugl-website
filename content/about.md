At Ubongo Game Lab, weâ€™re actively interested in facilitating the growth of game development within Zambia and Sub-Saharan Africa through workshops, training and providing resources to game developers within the region. We see it as an opportunity to create meaningful interactive content, transform education and preserve local art and culture on our continent.

Since 2013 we've hosted over 30 workshops and events related to game development from Global Game Jam Lusaka to casual show-and-tell meetups to our annual all female game development workshops.

Keep your eyes peeled for our upcoming workshops in 2019.
