At Ubongo Game Lab, weâ€™re actively interested in facilitating the growth of game development within Zambia and Sub-Saharan Africa through workshops, training and providing resources to game developers within the region. We see it as an opportunity to create meaningful interactive content, transform education and preserve local art and culture on our continent.
