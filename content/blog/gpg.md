Games Plus Girls is an annual workshop hosted by Ubongo Game Lab since 2015 to increase women's participation in game development.

After hosting our first few game development events and noticing that the existing game development community in Zambia was 100% male, we decided to work with the Asikana Network (a women in tech community in Zambia) to host an all-female game development bootcamp that has become an annual tradition. Each year the 2-day workshop chooses a different focus with the overall goal of increasing female collaboration and participation among Zambian game developers in preparation for the Global Game Jam. We have worked with various technologies during our workshops including Stencyl, Construct, GameMaker Studio and Twine.
