On Saturday 16th January 2016 we had our first Interactive fiction workshop with Twine. We got to see gamers get into writing and writers get into gaming. We had some talented writers and hope to see more Zambians in this genre. Benny and Lo from the Mundane Kid also inspired us with a talk about their creative process for their webcomic.

This workshop had a great impact on accessibility for game development in Zambia with many continuing to use interactive fiction as their tool of choice for Global Game Jam in Zambia.
