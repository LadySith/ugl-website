The [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/) is the worldâ€™s largest game development event where people in different physical locations simultaneously spend 48 hours creating a game around a specified theme. This is by far the most productive time of the year for game development in Zambia as we have consistently taken part in the Global Game Jam since 2014. Sithe is currently the Regional Organizer in charge of approving sites in Sub-Saharan Africa for the Global Game Jam and maintains relationships with most of the sites within the region. As of 2018, [Agora Code Community](https://www.facebook.com/agoracodecomm/) has fully taken on the role of organizing Global Game Jam Lusaka.
